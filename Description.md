TEAM PROJECT:

Short Description:
	
	I'm attempting to create a TBR (To Be Read) List / Project / App. I need to download a database of almost every book on goodreads, for which i will be using an old database since goodreads doesn't really allow public API usage anymore. Features I will attempt to add is thus:
		Books -> a list of all books, from goodreads, with ISBN number, book name, author name, etc. Unfortunately I can't seem to get the book descriptions and covers without using a public API, which I'm unsure if is within the scope of this project

		Login system -> auth system, with privatized data stored online for each user. Each user will also have a profile with a username, profile picture, favorite books, book reviews, etc

		Reading Lists -> To Be Read, Currently Reading, DNF, Has Read list.
							- I want users to be able to give books a star rating, review, etc. The review will be able to be seen by other users of the app.

		Recommendation System -> This isn't database related exactly, so I'm not sure if I will really add it or not. 

		Friends / Followed Profiles -> most likely will not add this, but it would allow each user to have friends / followed profiles where you could see other's people's reading lists, recommendations, favorited books, and the current books they are reading. This is likely beyond the scope of this project.

	NOTE: I used AI to help make a rough draft of the database tables / the diagram. It will be rough and not everything will make sense.


	For the Recording, well, this is supposed to be a rough draft, i don't have everything including a UI planned, so videos won't do much good. So I guess heres a highly advanced recording of me doing complicated SQL on the first try.
